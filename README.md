## Design

### idea
The idea is to have a 1.2 x the lineheigth for the header design and 1.4 or 1.5 for the body text.
About the letter spacing -1 or -2 % or at least -0.5 % for the heading.
Two font size 1 for header 1 for body text, and use color or font weight for the hierachy.
spacing: if between the bottom heading and the bottom body is 1 like 16 px then the distance between the bottom heading and the top body should be 2x 32px
